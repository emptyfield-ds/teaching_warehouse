# Exercise

Create a new Shiny app to show a lineplot of the gapminder and a table of the data. Use the sidebar layout approach. 
Put the plot and data table in separate tabs. Make sure your app has a title.

Additionally, this app should:

1. Have a default ggplot that:
 * shows life expectancy over time, colored and grouped by country
 * facets by continent
2. Allow the user to filter by continent
3. Allow the user to specify the year range using a slider
4. Have a data table (either using DT or a static table) that shows the data you're using
