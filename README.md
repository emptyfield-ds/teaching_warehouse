# R Teaching Warehouse

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

This is a warehouse of teaching materials that I have developed
(sometimes with others) over the years to use in courses and workshops;
I keep the latest versions of these materials here. For more details on
my courses, [visit my website](https://malco.io/training/).

Many elements of these materials were inspired by the [Master the
Tidyverse](https://github.com/rstudio/master-the-tidyverse) workshop
offered by RStudio but generally focus more on the needs of health
researchers. The Shiny materials here were heavily influenced by the
[full day Shiny workshop](https://github.com/dtkaplan/shinymark) offered
by RStudio. Additionally, many of my amazing collaborators have
influenced or contributed to this work:

  - [Corinne Riddell](https://corinne-riddell.github.io/)
  - [Martin Frigaard](https://www.martinfrigaard.io/)
  - [Emil Hvitfeldt](https://www.hvitfeldt.me/about/)
  - [Lucy D’Agostino McGowan](https://www.lucymcgowan.com/)
  - [Richard Iannone](https://randr.rocks/)

My thanks to all of them, as well as RStudio, for their contributions to
these materials and generally to the R community\!
