### *Exercise*

#### The purpose of this exercise is to re-create a publication-ready plot using your `dplyr` and `ggplot2` skills.

#### Open the Financial Times article, [Coronavirus tracked: the latest figures as countries start to reopen](https://www.ft.com/content/a26fbf7e-48f8-11ea-aeb3-955839e06441)

#### There is also a PDF of the article titled, "*2020-07-24-excess_mortality.pdf*"

####  The data you need is "data/ft_excess_deaths.csv"

####  You'll have 1 hour to see what you can come up with in groups or individually!

### Financial Times Figure

```{r ft-covid-19-jul-recreate, out.width="80%", fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/ft-covid-19-jul-recreate.png")
```

## You got this.

### Don't worry about making it exactly, try and see how far you can get. 

### You're encouraged to work together if you want to and exchange tips/tricks you figured out.

knitr::include_graphics("img/ft-covid-19-jun-recreate.jpeg")
