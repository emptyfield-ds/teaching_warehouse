# Exercise

The purpose of this exercise is to make a publication-ready plot using your `dplyr` and `ggplot2` skills. Open article from the Financial Times (FT), called "2020-07-24-excess_mortality.pdf". 

Read the article and have a look at the figure titled, *Death rates have climbed far above historical averages in many countries that have faced Covid-19 outbreaks* (on the third page). 

The data you need is "`ft_excess_deaths.csv`" in the `data` folder. 

You got this. Don't worry about making it exactly; try and see how far you can get. You're encouraged to work together if you want to and exchange tips/tricks you figured out. At the bottom of this document, the "Resources" section may have a few helpful things to check out.

First, load the packages you need.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Import the data

Import the .csv file below into `ft_excess_deaths` using `read_csv()`

```{r}
#| label: import-ft_excess_deaths
ft_excess_deaths <- ________("data/ft_excess_deaths.csv")
```

To make our lives easier when we get to plotting, we'll also change "year" to an ordered factor. We'll cover factors, and why they're useful when you're plotting, later in the course. 

```{r}
#| label: year-factor
ft_excess_deaths <- mutate(ft_excess_deaths, year = ordered(year))
```

### View the data 

Use `glimpse()` to view the `ft_excess_deaths` data. 

```{r}
#| label: glimpse
glimpse(______)
```

The skimr package has a function called `skim()`, which is a useful way to take a quick look at your data. Load the skimr package, then call `skim()` on `ft_excess_deaths`.

```{r}
#| label: skimr
library(______)
_________
```


What are the variables measuring? The authors included a data dictionary in the [README file](https://github.com/Financial-Times/coronavirus-excess-mortality-data/blob/master/README.md) associated with these data: 

```
## Data definitions

For each jurisdiction and each weekly or monthly period, the data contains the 
following fields:

* `country`: the country to which the data applies  
* `region`: where applicable, the subnational or administrative region. This   
   duplicated `country` for national-level data  
* `period`: the period for which the data is collected. This can be “week” or   
   “month”; data reported daily has been aggregated into weeks   
* `year`: the year within which the period ends. The is the same as the year   
   element of the `date` field.  
* `month`: the month within which the period ends. This is the same as the   
   month element of the `date` field.   
* `week`: week number is either taken exactly from countries’ own data, or is  
   calculated using the following method: for countries reporting daily data, 
   we take the most recent run of seven days in the data to be the most recent
   week, and then aggregate each prior seven-day run into a new week, with any
   trailing period fewer than seven days at start of January clipped off  
* `date`: the date at which the week ends  
* `deaths`: historical daily, weekly or monthly numbers of all-cause deaths for
   as far back as we have been able to obtain this data  
* `expected_deaths`: the median value of this data for the equivalent period in
   years from 2015 to 2019   
* `excess_deaths`: difference between `deaths` and `expected deaths` (negative
   values indicate fewer deaths than the recent historical average)
* `excess_deaths_pct`: `excess_deaths` as a percentage of `expected_deaths`   
```

### How many countries are in this dataset?

Use `distinct()` to determine which countries are in the `country`.

```{r}
#| label: distinct-countries
distinct(ft_excess_deaths, _______)
```


## Start small 

Let's start by building a single plot like the ones in the FT graphic. Take a closer look at the UK panel in the article plot; we'll try to create just this panel first.

In order to build this graph, we will need to filter `ft_excess_deaths` to only the data for `"UK"` and store it in `uk_excess_deaths`. 

```{r}
#| label: create-uk_excess_deaths
uk_excess_deaths <- ft_excess_deaths |>
  ____________

uk_excess_deaths
```

### What can we learn from the labels? 

Take another look at the image of the UK plot. The labels and subtitles tells us that we're looking at three metrics: 1) the number of deaths from all causes in 2020, and the number of deaths from previous years (lines in gray), and the historical average (black line).

We're going to build this graph from `uk_excess_deaths`, and then apply what we've learned to the entire `ft_excess_deaths` dataset. 

## Building the plot layer-by-layer

Each section below covers how to build the FT plot, one layer at a time. 

### Layer 1: Deaths from recent years

The first layer we will build is the lines for recent years, which we will call `uk_excess_deaths_prior` and it includes all years prior to 2020. These show up in the original plot as light grey lines in the background of the excess mortality geom.

```{r}
#| label: create-uk_excess_deaths_prior
uk_excess_deaths_prior <- uk_excess_deaths |>
  filter(_____ != 2020)

# how many years do we have data for? What do we expect to see?
distinct(uk_excess_deaths_prior, year)
```

Our final plot will have `deaths` on the `y` axis, and `week`s across the `x`. `deaths` represents the average number of deaths per week, so we already have everything we need. Let's make a first attempt at the plot! Map `x` to `week`, `y` to `deaths`, and `group` to `year`, then add `geom_line()`. Make sure to connect your geom with the labels using `+`

```{r}
#| label: check-years
ggplot(
  uk_excess_deaths_prior, 
  aes(_______, _______, _______)
) +
  _______ 
  labs(
    x = "Date", 
    y = "Deaths",
    title = "Death rates in UK compared to historical averages",
    subtitle = "Number of deaths per week from all causes  vs. recent years"
  )
```

Your plot should look something like this:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://i.imgur.com/rwoVzw7.png")
```

These will be our previous year lines. Now we can plot the mean `deaths` per `week` grouped by `year` for the `"UK"` and store it in `gg_uk_recent_years`.

In `geom_line()`, add `color = "grey75"` and make the lines slightly transparent with `alpha = 0.6`.

```{r}
#| label: gg_uk_recent_years
gg_uk_recent_years <- ggplot(
  uk_excess_deaths_prior, 
  aes(x = week, y = deaths, group = year)
) +
  geom_line(______, _______) +
  labs(
    x = "Date", 
    y = "Deaths",
    title = "Death rates in UK compared to historical averages",
    subtitle = "Number of deaths per week from all causes  vs. recent years"
  )

gg_uk_recent_years
```

Your plot should look something like this:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://i.imgur.com/VrRpgt3.png")
```

### Layer 2: Excess deaths (2020)

The second layer will be mean deaths per week in 2020 (in other words, during the coronavirus pandemic). 

Filter `uk_excess_deaths` to only include 2020, saving it as `uk_excess_deaths_2020`

```{r}
#| label: create-uk_excess_deaths_2020
uk_excess_deaths_2020 ___ ________ ___
  ________

uk_excess_deaths_2020
```

Now, we'll add another layer to the existing ggplot2 object (`gg_uk_recent_years`). For this layer, we'll use the same aesthetics but with these new data. Each geom inherits data from `ggplot()`, but you can use a different dataset using the `data` argument directly in the geom.

Add an additional `geom_line()`. Set the `data` argument to `uk_excess_deaths_2020`. Additionally, Set the `color` argument to "firebrick". Then, take a look at the plot. 

```{r}
#| label: gg_uk_excess_deaths-uk_labs
gg_uk_excess_deaths <- gg_uk_recent_years +
  ____________

gg_uk_excess_deaths
```

Your plot should look something like this:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://i.imgur.com/dozzQCY.png")
```

### Layer 3: Total excess deaths (shading)

The third layer uses the same data we've created above, but with a `geom_ribbon()`. 

This time, we'll set some new aesthetics inside the new geom (`geom_ribbon(aes())`). `geom_ribbon()` takes two additional aesthetics: `ymin` and `ymax`, referring to the bottom and top of the shading. 

*Pay attention to when we need `deaths` and when we need `expected_deaths`!!*

We want the the bottom of the ribbon area (`ymin`) to be the mean `expected_deaths`, but we don't want it to draw the shading if `expected_deaths` is less than the observed `deaths`. In other words, we want `ymin` to be whichever is lower: `expected_deaths` or `deaths`. For that we can use `pmin()`. We want the top of the ribbon area (`ymax`) to extend to the top of the mean `deaths` variable.

Set `ymin` to `pmin(expected_deaths, deaths)` and `ymax` to `deaths`. Outside the `aes()`, also set `fill` to `"tomato"` and the `alpha` to `0.5`.

```{r}
#| label: gg_uk_total_excess_deaths
gg_uk_total_excess_deaths <- gg_uk_excess_deaths +
  _______(
    data = uk_excess_deaths_2020,
    aes(ymin = _______, ymax = _______), 
    fill = "_______", 
    alpha = ___
  )
  
gg_uk_total_excess_deaths
```

Your plot should look something like this:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://i.imgur.com/EfQzXpT.png")
```

### Layer 4: Historical averages 

The final layer will be the historical average (the `mean` for **all** `year`s in the `"UK"` before `2020`). Instead of using the average of the years in the dataset, we'll used the `expected_deaths` variable that the authors calculated. In fact, `expected_deaths` is calculated the same way for every year (because it's based on all observed years), so we can grab this variable from any year. 

Since we want to know about the excess deaths in 2020, though, let's get the `expected_deaths` for that year. We actually already created a data set that has what we need in it: `uk_excess_deaths_2020`, which has both `deaths` and `expected_deaths`.

Now we can plot the historical average line, but we need to make sure we aren't inheriting any aesthetics from the previous layers (we're using `expected_deaths` instead of `deaths`, and ggplot is expecting a year variable that we don't need for this geom), so we'll add `inherit.aes = FALSE` to the geom. This line will have `week` on the `x` axis, and `expected_deaths` on the `y` axis. The `color` argument will be placed outside `aes()`, and it should be set to "black".

```{r}
#| label: gg_uk_historical_average
gg_uk_historical_average <- gg_uk_total_excess_deaths +
  # what kind of geom should this be?
  _______(
    data = uk_excess_deaths_2020,
    aes(_______, _______),
    color = _______,
    inherit.aes = FALSE 
  ) 

gg_uk_historical_average 
```

Your plot should look something like this:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://i.imgur.com/q6KEBaf.png")
```

### Layer 5: Add text annotations

The FT graph has a text annotation on the `"UK"` plot, which displays the excess deaths and percent. Our data looks slightly different than the data in the FT graph, but the trends is nearly identical. 

We're going to use `annotate()` to add the annotations on the graph (for ease, we'll assume the numbers in FT graph is correct rather than calculating them ourselves).

`annotate()` is a way of using geoms to draw anywhere on your plot. We won't use `aes()` for this function! If you get lost here, read the help page for `annotate()` by running ?annotate in the console.

1. Add `annotate()` to `gg_uk_historical_average`. Don't forget to connect them with `+`!
2. Set the `geom` argument to "text" (under the hood, this is calling the very useful `geom_text()` function)
3. Set `x` to 25 and `y` to 20000 (these are where the annotation will show up, so you can play with them as you wish) 
4. Set the `label` argument to "65,700\nexcess\ndeaths\n(+45%)". (PS: wondering what's up with the "\n" thing? The labels require a little formatting for new lines; ggplot2 (and many other tools) will insert a new line anywhere you write "\n")
5. Use the same `color`, "firebrick", as the 2020 line

```{r}
#| label: gg_text_annotations
gg_text_annotations <- ____________
  ____________
  
gg_text_annotations
```

Your plot should look something like this:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://i.imgur.com/RhQiKQO.png")
```

For the arrow, we'll add a second annotation with `annotate()` with the segment geom. Again, we won't use `aes()`; we'll just give the arguments directly to `annotate()`

1. Add `annotate()` to `gg_text_annotations`. Don't forget to connect them with `+`!
2. Set `geom` to "segment". Like the text annotation, this links the annotation to the underlying function `geom_segment()`
3. Set `x` to 20 and `xend` to 16.5, 
4. Set `y` to 20000 and `yend` to 20001
5. Set the `arrow` argument to `arrow(length = unit(0.14, "cm"), type = "closed")`. This is a function that creates an arrowhead shape.
6. Set `color` to "black"

```{r}
#| label: gg_arrow_segment
# add the arrows 
gg_arrow_segment <- ____________
  ____________

gg_arrow_segment 
``` 

Your plot should look something like this:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://i.imgur.com/6YPliGW.png")
```

### Add theme

We're pretty close! Interestingly, the Financial Times team has its own R package, [`ftplottools`](https://github.com/Financial-Times/ftplottools), for use in their articles. ftplottools includes a ggplot2 theme function, `ft_theme()`, similar to the original plot's theme (although there are some differences, including the default background color).

Load ftplottools with `library()`, then add `ft_theme()` to `gg_arrow_segment`.

```{r}
#| label: ft_theme
# Finish your plot with a theme!

```

Your plot should look something like this:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://i.imgur.com/pf2pWYx.png")
```

## Rinse, repeat

Now that we've created a graph for a single country that looks similar to the FT graph, we can apply the same process to all the countries in the data. From this point on, you'll use what you've learned so far in the course and in this assignment to make a plot similar to what we saw in the article. Change the skeleton code in the next two sections to make the plot yourself!

### Create the data layers 

For the UK data, we made two data sets that we used in the plot. We'll need to make them for the entire dataset now. We'll end up with two datasets: `excess_deaths_prior` and `excess_deaths_2020`. Use the code you wrote for the UK data above as a basis for making these datasets.

As a reminder, the data frame with the data for every country is called `ft_excess_deaths`.

```{r}
#| label: facet-data
# create a dataset called excess_deaths_prior
  
# create a dataset called excess_deaths_2020

```

### Creating the plot and adding facets

To create a plot similar to the one in the FT times, we'll need to duplicate each layer in the line graph for all 21 countries in the datasets we just made. We can do this easily by adding `facet_wrap()`!

When we facet our data by `country`, we will want to allow each facet have differing y axes (since each country has different baseline mortality), so we'll add the `scales = "free_y"` argument. 

As a reminder, `facet_wrap()` usually looks something like this: `facet_wrap(~ variable_name, scales = "free_y")`

For ease, we won't add the text annotations to this plot, although ggplot2 can certainly handle it. 
Fill in the skeleton code to create a facetted plot.

```{r}
#| label: gg_by_country
gg_by_country <- ggplot(
  data = excess_deaths_prior,
  aes() 
) +
  # Add the grey historical lines (layer 1)
  _________() +
  # Add the 2020 mortality line (layer 2)
  _________() +
  # Add the excess mortality shading (layer 3)
  _________() +
  # Add the historical mean mortality line (layer 4)
  _________() +
  # Use facet_wrap() to facet this plot by country. Set the scales to "free_y"
  _________() +
  # Add appropriate labels to the plot
  _________()
```

Alright, let's take a look!

```{r}
#| label: gg_by_country-final
#| fig.height: 5.0
#| fig.width: 7.0
gg_by_country + 
  ft_theme()
```

Your plot should look something like this:

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://i.imgur.com/i05JvCi.png")
```

You did it! You can stop here, and only up to this point will be graded. Below this point, you'll have the opportunity to try out themes a bit more, if you like. At the bottom of the document, you'll find several resources related to this exercise.

### Bonus: Add a custom theme

Want a little more challenge? Try making your own theme to add to your plot. 

Instead of `ft_theme(), use `theme()` to make the following changes to the graph. As a reminder, many of the `theme()` arguments take `element_()` functions. For help, check out the [themes chapter](https://ggplot2-book.org/polishing.html) of the ggplot2 book.

1. Change the fill of the `plot.background` and `panel.background` by setting `fill` to `"#FFF1E5"` inside `element_rect()`, 
2. Change the color of the `panel.grid` to `"grey90"` inside `element_line()`
3. Change the `axis.text` and `axis.title` font size to `7` and `11`, respectively, and the family to `"Courier"` inside `element_text()`
4. Change the font size to 15 and family to `"Verdana"` for the `plot.title`  inside `element_text()`, 
5. Remove the `panel.border` and `strip.background` with `element_blank()`


```{r}
#| label: my_theme
my_theme <- theme(
  
) 
```

Let's take a look!

```{r}
#| label: gg_by_country-my_theme-labs
#| fig.height: 5.0
#| fig.width: 7.0
gg_by_country + 
  my_theme
```

Custom theming is a rich area in ggplot2. Many community members have created their own extensions with beautiful themes, as well. One great set of themes for scientific publications is in the [cowplot package](https://wilkelab.org/cowplot/articles/themes.html). [ggthemes](https://github.com/jrnold/ggthemes) and [hrbrthemes](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/hrbrthemes) also have many interesting and pretty themes.
