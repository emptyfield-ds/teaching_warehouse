# R Teaching Warehouse
<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This is a warehouse of teaching materials that I have developed (sometimes with others) over the years to use in courses and workshops; I keep the latest versions of these materials here. For more details on my courses, [visit my website](https://malco.io/training/).

Many elements of these materials were inspired by the [Master the Tidyverse](https://github.com/rstudio/master-the-tidyverse) workshop offered by RStudio but generally focus more on the needs of health researchers. The Shiny materials here were heavily influenced by the [full day Shiny workshop](https://github.com/dtkaplan/shinymark) offered by RStudio. Additionally, many of my amazing collaborators have influenced or contributed to this work:

* [Corinne Riddell](https://corinne-riddell.github.io/)
* [Martin Frigaard](https://www.martinfrigaard.io/)
* [Emil Hvitfeldt](https://www.hvitfeldt.me/about/)
* [Lucy D'Agostino McGowan](https://www.lucymcgowan.com/)
* [Richard Iannone](https://randr.rocks/)

My thanks to all of them, as well as RStudio, for their contributions to these materials and generally to the R community!

## Quarto Project Profiles

This repository is configured as a Quarto project with two profiles:

### Dev Profile (Default)
The default profile renders all `.qmd` files in the repository. To use it:
```bash
quarto render
```

### Mastering-R Profile
The `mastering-r` profile is designed for the Mastering R course and:
- Renders only specific modules used in the course
- Disables caching (`cache: false`) to ensure fresh renders
- Runs `R/sync_mastering_r.R` as a post-render script

To use the mastering-r profile:
```bash
quarto render --profile mastering-r
```
