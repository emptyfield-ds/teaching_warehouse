## Your Turn 1

- Load the `gh` module and clone the repository: `gh repo clone emptyfield-ds/hpc_reproducibility`
- Check out the file `python/sim_pt.py` to see the code we are going to run. You don't need to make any changes here.
- Open `slurm/sim_pt.sbatch`. This is the Slurm sbatch file we are going to submit to the job scheduler.
- Fill in the sbatch parameters. Remember you can't have spaces!
  * Set the job name to whatever you like
  * Use `sherrir,normal` for the partition
  * For the output and the error, we are going to name them with file patterns: %x is the job name and %a is the array number. We'll put them in the `logs/` folder
      - logs/%x_%a.out
      - logs/%x_%a.err
  * Use 1 node, 1 task, 4 cpus per task, 4G of memory, and set the job time to ten minutes (00:10:00)
  * Use arrays to create 5 jobs
- Load the most recent version of python
- Run `python/sim_pt.py` with `python3` and pass it the Task ID and CPU count that we set. These are automatically available as two environmental variables:
  * $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID
  * $SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK
- Use `sbatch` to submit the file to the job scheduler and use `squeue --me` to keep an eye on the jobs.
- When the job has finished, review the `logs/` for errors and confirm the `results/`

## Your Turn 2

First, you will need to install the package we need for this script.

In the terminal, run:

```
python/3.14
python3 -m pip install --user polars
```

- Check out the file `python/sim_positivity.py` to see the code we are going to run for the rest of the exercises. You don't need to make any changes here.
- Open `slurm/sim_pt.sbatch`. We'll use this file for the rest of the exercises
- Set the job to use arrays `0-2`
- Load the modules `python/3.14` and `py-numpy/2.3.5_py314`
- Use the following command to run the script:

```
python3 python/sim_positivity.py \
    --sims 10000 \
    --subjects 1000 \
    --gamma $CURRENT_GAMMA \
    --out "results/sim_positivity_py_${SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID}.csv"
```

- Submit the job and review the logs and files when completed

## Your Turn 3

First, you will need to set up the virtual environment. In the terminal, run:

```
ml uv
uv init --bare
uv add polars numpy
```

Next, make the following changes to `slurm/sim_positivity.sbatch`:
- Remove the numpy module and replace it with `ml uv`
- Change the script execution to use `uv run` instead of `python3`

 Submit the batch file and review the results and logs.

## Your Turn 4

Open `container_py.def`, and make the following changes:
    - Use the docker image `python:3.14-slim`
    - Copy the `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` files over to the container
    - Restore the packages in the lock file with `uv sync`

Next, build the container with `apptainer build`. The first argument is the name of the sif file you want to make, `container_py.sif`. The next is the name of the definition file to build it from.

Let's make sure we can access the packages we installed from within the container. Open a shell into the container with:

- `apptainer exec container_py.sif bash`

First, activate the virtual environment with `source .venv/bin/activate` Then, open R with `python3`. Load polars to make sure it works. Exit python with `quit()` then exit the container with `exit`

Next, make the following changes to `slurm/sim_positivity.sbatch`:
- Remove the module load commands
- Put `apptainer exec container_py.sif` in front of `uv run`. This will excecute the command from within the container.

Submit the job and review the results and logs.
