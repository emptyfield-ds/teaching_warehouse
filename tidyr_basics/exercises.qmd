## Your Turn 1

Use `pivot_longer()` to reorganize `table4a` into three columns: **country**, **year**, and **cases**.

```{r}

```

## Your Turn 2

1. Use `pivot_wider()` to reorganize `table2` into four columns: **country**, **year**, **cases**, and **population**. 
2. Create a new variable called `prevalence` that divides `cases` by `population` multiplied by 100000.
3. Pass the data frame to a ggplot. Make a scatter plot with `year` on the x axis and `prevalence` on the y axis. Set the color aesthetic (`aes()`) to `country`. Use `size = 2` for the points. Add a line geom. 

```{r}
table2 |> 
  ________ |> 
  ________ |> 
  ggplot(________) + 
  ________(size = 2) +
  ________ + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1999L, 2000L))
```

## Your Turn 3

Pivot the 5th through 60th columns of `who` so that the names of the columns go into a new variable called `codes` and the values go into a new variable called `n`. Then select just the `country`, `year`, `codes` and `n` variables.

```{r}
who
```

## Your Turn 4

Use the `cases` data below. Separate the `sex_age` column into **sex** and **age** columns.

```{r}
cases <- tribble(
   ~id,     ~sex_age,
   "1",    "male_56",
   "2",  "female_77",    
   "3",  "female_49"
)
separate(_______, _______, into = c("_______", "_______"))
```

## Your Turn 5: Challenge!

There are two CSV files in this folder containing SEER data in breast cancer incidence in white and black women. For both sets of data:

1. Import the data
2. Pivot the columns into 2 new columns called `year` and `incidence`
3. Add a new variable called `race`. Remember that each data set corresponds to a single race.
4. Bind the data sets together using `bind_rows()` from the dplyr package. Either save it as a new object or pipe the result directly into the ggplot2 code.
5. Plot the data using the code below. Fill in the blanks to have `year` on the x-axis, `incidence` on the y-axis, and `race` as the color aesthetic. 

```{r}


______ |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = ______, y = ______, color = ______, group = race)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() + 
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = seq(1975, 2011, by = 5)) # show years by fives
```

# Take Aways

Data comes in many formats but R prefers just one: _tidy data_.

A data set is tidy if and only if:

1. Every variable is in its own column
2. Every observation is in its own row
3. Every value is in its own cell (which follows from the above)

What is a variable and an observation may depend on your immediate goal.
